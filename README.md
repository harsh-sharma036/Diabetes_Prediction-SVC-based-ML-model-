Hello Everyone, myself Harsh Sharma.
I had created this ML model to predict whether the women is diabetic or not based on the following labels: 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin',
       'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age'.
I had used Support Vector Algorithm to train the model .
